# vortex-tracking
Scripts and routines to perform vortex tracking of complex fields. Based on the ideas and results presented in Alberto Villois et al. 2016 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 49 415502, [DOI 10.1088/1751-8113/49/41/415502](https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/49/41/415502).

## Tracking in 2D
Run the Python vortexTracking.py script, which loads the test file psiField2D.npy.
The script requires Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.
