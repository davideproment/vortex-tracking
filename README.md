# vortex-tracking
Scripts and routines to perform vortex tracking of complex fields. 
The fields are assumed to be spatially periodic and represented on uniform spatial grids.



## Tracking in 2D
Run the Python vortexTracking.py script, which loads the test file psiField2D.npy.
The script requires Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.
